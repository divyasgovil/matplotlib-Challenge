As a senior data analyst at the company, we have access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. We are tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a top-level summary of the study results.

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:
1. Prepare the data.
2. Generate summary statistics.
3. Create bar charts and pie charts.
4. Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
5. Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
6. Calculate correlation and regression.
